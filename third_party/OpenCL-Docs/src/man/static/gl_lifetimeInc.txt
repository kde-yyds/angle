.Lifetime of [GL] Shared Objects

An OpenCL memory object created from an OpenGL object (hereinafter refered
to as a "shared CL/GL object") remains valid as long as the corresponding GL
object has not been deleted. If the GL object is deleted through the GL API
(e.g. `glDeleteBuffers`, `glDeleteTextures`, or `glDeleteRenderbuffers`),
subsequent use of the CL buffer or image object will result in undefined
behavior, including but not limited to possible CL errors and data
corruption, but may not result in program termination.

The CL context and corresponding command-queues are dependent on the
existence of the GL share group object, or the share group associated with
the GL context from which the CL context is created. If the GL share group
object or all GL contexts in the share group are destroyed, any use of the
CL context or command-queue(s) will result in undefined behavior, which may
include program termination. Applications should destroy the CL
command-queue(s) and CL context before destroying the corresponding GL share
group or contexts.
